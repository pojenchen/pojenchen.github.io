Welcome to my website!  

I'm a master student of [Tsung-Te Liu](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile2.php?id=1020909) in [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/)
and I'm also a research assistant of [Tung Chou](https://tungchou.github.io/) in [Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/).
Currently, I'm finalising my master thesis while pursuing a PhD degree in Security and Crypto.

I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University.
During the undergraduate, I worked with [Tsung-Te Liu](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile2.php?id=1020909) on the elliptic curve cryptographic processor. 

My research goal is to provide flexible and cost-efficient solutions from the viewpoint of architecture.
Recently I have worked on implementing the public-key generator for [post-quantum cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions), that is, cryptosystems deployed in classical computers conjectured to be secure against attacks from large-scale quantum computers.
