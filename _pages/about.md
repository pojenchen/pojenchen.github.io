Welcome to my website!  

I'm a master student of [Tsung-Te Liu](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile2.php?id=1020909) in [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/)
and I'm also a research assistant of [Tung Chou](https://tungchou.github.io/) in [Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/).
Currently, I'm doiny my military service while seeking for a job in the industry.
<!-- Currently, I'm finalising my master thesis while applying a PhD degree in Hardware Security.   -->

My research interest includes
VLSI Design for Secure Primitives or Digital Signal Processing, Chip Security, Secure Hardwareâ€‘Software Architectures, and Cryptography.

Recently I have worked on implementing the public-key generator for [post-quantum cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions), that is, 
cryptosystems deployed in classical computers conjectured to be secure against attacks from large-scale quantum computers.
