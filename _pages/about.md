Welcome to my website!  

I'm a master student of [Tsung-Te Liu](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile2.php?id=1020909)
and I'm currently 

Hi! I'm a third-year master student in [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering at National Taiwan University](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/), where I work with [Tsung-Te Liu](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile2.php?id=1020909).  

My research goal is to provide flexible and cost-efficient solutions from the viewpoint of architecture.
Recently I have worked on implementing the public-key generator for [post-quantum cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions), that is, cryptosystems deployed in classical computers conjectured to be secure against attacks from large-scale quantum computers.
