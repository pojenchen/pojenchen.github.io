### Motion Estimation/Compensation (MEMC)  
Course Final Project of *Computer-Aided Vlsi System Design*  
- Adopted down sampling for image pixels, shrunk search range within matching blocks, and early skipping for min-max error.  
- Scheduled truncated pixels of separated images into one SRAM and parallelized the computation with 4 process elements.  

### Miller's Algorithm in Pairing-Based Cryptography  
Course Final Project of *Cryptography*  
- Surveyed algorithmic improvements to decrease the complexity of Miller's algorithm.  

### Baby-Step Giant-Step Attack on Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol  
Course Final Project of *Integrated Circuits Design Laboratory*  
- Organized the architect and instructed team members to accomplish encryption/decryption (DES) and key-exchange protocol (DHKE).  
- Implemented Montgomery multiplication/division for arithmetic computation over Galois field.  
- **Fabricated in 180-nm CMOS technology and validated with measurement results**  

### Frequency Analysis System  
Summer Training in [Energy-Efficient Circuits and Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/eecs.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eecslab)  
- Employed *transposed* finite impulse response filter to shorten the critical path and reduce the number of adders.  
- Exploited radix-$2^2$ 16-point FFT to reduce the multiplicative complexity.  
- Searched the main frequency with *folding* architect to share datapath logic.  

### Parallelism Factor of 2D Convolution Circuit in 28-nm CMOS Technology  
Course Final Project of *Digital Signal Processing in Vlsi Design*  
- to be done.

### 5-Stage Pipelined MIPS  
Course Final Project of *Digital System Design*  
- Extended pipelined multiplication/division to shorten critical path and carried Booth's algorithm to facilitate recursive computation.  
- Exploited the advantage of locality through multi-levels of caches with different read/write policies.
